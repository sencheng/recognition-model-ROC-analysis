function predData = msd_calc_pred_data(pars,nTarg,nLure,output)
% usage: 
%   predData = msd_calc_pred_data(pars,nTarg,nLure,output)
%
% MSD_CALC_PREDICTED_DATA returns the predicted frequencies, proportions,
% cumulative proportions, and z-values for the MSD model with a 
% given set of parameters and criterion locations.
%
% Input:
%   pars - An MxN vector of paramter values for the MSD model. See 
%   MSD_GEN_PARS for more information and to create this vector.
%
%   nTarg - The number of target trials in a given condition. The length
%   of this vector must be equal to size(pars,1) and length(nLure). 
%
%   nLure - The number of lure trials in a given condition. The length
%   of this vector must be equal to size(pars,1) and length(nTarg). 
%
%   output - A string variable specifying the type of predicted data to
%   calculate. 'points' will return the predicted data for each rating bin
%   specified by the pars input. 'roc' will return the predicted data for a
%   wide range of criterion values, which is useful for plotting a
%   hypothetical ROC function. The only difference is in the criterion
%   parameters that are used (points uses the criterion location specified
%   in the pars variable, whereas roc uses a range from -3 to +3). 
%
% NOTE: The number of rating bins estimated is determined by the number of 
% criterion values +1 (i.e., length(pars(5:length(pars))+1). The number of
% target/lure conditions is estimated by the number of rows in pars (i.e.,
% size(pars,1))
