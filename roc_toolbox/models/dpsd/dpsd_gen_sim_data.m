function simData = dpsd_gen_sim_data(pars,nTarg,nLure,nSamples,ignoreConds,rngSeed)
% Usage: 
%   simData = dpsd_gen_sim_data(pars,nTarg,nLure,nSamples,ignoreConds)
%
% DPSD_GEN_SIM_DATA generates random data sets from the DPSD model using a
% bootstrap procedure. The random data sets are returned to a structure
% variable with a targf and luref fields. The frequency matrices are in a
% cell array, such that targf{1} and luref{1} correspond to the data sets
% generated in the first sample. 
%
% Required Input:
%   pars - An MxN vector of recollection and familairity parameters. The 1st
%   and 2nd elements represnt the recollection of oldness (Ro) and newness 
%   (Rn), respectively. The 3rd and 4th elements represent the mean and 
%   variance of the famliarity distribution, respectively. The remaining
%   elements of the vector are the criterion locations. The number of rows
%   corresponds to the number of unique target/lure conditions. See 
%   dpsd_gen_pars for more information and to create these vectors.
%
%   nTarg - A Mx1 column vector specificying the number of target trials.
%   The length of this vector must equal the number of rows in pars.
%
%   nLure - A Mx1 column vector specificying the number of lure trials. 
%   The length of this vector must equal the number of rows in pars.
%
%   nSamples - A scalar value specifying the number of random data sets to
%   generate.
%
% Optional Input:
%   ignoreConds - This is a N x 1 vector that identifies conditions whose
%   new items (luref) should not be simulated. Instead, the frequency of
%   responses for the conditions specified by this vector will be identical
%   to the frequencies in the condition one row above. This is useful for
%   simulating data from designs that have multiple types of target items
%   plotted against the same lure items. For example, say you have a design
%   with two types of target items and one class of lure items. Having
%   ignoreConds = 2; will result in luref(2,:) = luref(1,:). This option is
%   similar to the ignoreConds option in the roc_solver. 
%
%   rngSeed - Scalar value to seed the random number generator. Useful to
%   reproduce simulated data.
