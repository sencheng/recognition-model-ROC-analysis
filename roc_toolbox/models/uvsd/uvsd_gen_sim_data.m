function simData = uvsd_gen_sim_data(pars,nTarg,nLure,nSamples,ignoreConds,rngSeed)
% usage: 
%   simData = uvsd_gen_sim_data(pars,nTarg,nLure,nSamples)
%
% UVSD_GEN_SIM_DATA generates random data sets from the UVSD model using a
% bootstrap procedure. 
%
% Required Input:
%   pars - A MxN matrix of memory strength (d') and variance (Vo)
%   parameters. See UVSD_GEN_PARS for more information and to create this 
%   vector.
%
%   nTarg - A Mx1 column vector specificying the number of trials. The
%   length of this vector must equal the number of rows in pars.
%
%   nLure - A Mx1 column vector specificying the number of trials. The
%   length of this vector must equal the number of rows in pars.
%
%   nSamples - A scalar value specifying the number of random data sets to
%   generate. 
%
% Output:
%   The output is a structure variable containing a field for target
%   (targf) and lure (luref) frequencies. The frequencies are output to a
%   cell array. Each cell represents a randomly generated data set. Note
%   that, for instance, targf{1} and luref{1} correspond to the data sets
%   generated in the first sample.
