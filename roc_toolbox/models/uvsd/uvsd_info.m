function outInfo = uvsd_info(type)
% Usage:
%   outInfo = uvsd_info(type);
%
% UVSD_INFO returns information about the UVSD model. 
%
% Required input:
%   type - This specifies what information about the model to return. There
%   are three possibilities:
%
%       1) 'parNames' will return all possible parameters for the dpsd
%       model (exlcuding the criterion parameters).
%
%       2) 'field' will return the field name to be used in the
%       structured output from the ROC_SOLVER. 
%
%       3) 'nPars' will return the number of possible parameters
%       (excluding criterion parameters, which are experiment
%       specific).
