% This is the code that accompanies tutorial 1. The aim of this tutorial is
% to:
%   1) Learn how the targf and luref vectors are formatted
%   2) Generate the parameter vectors for the experimental design
%   3) Use to roc_solver function to fit a model to some data
%   4) Explore the options of the roc_solver
%   5) Fit multiple models to the same data set and store the output in the
%   same variable using roc_solver

%% Clear workspace and command window
clear all;
clc;

%% Load the data in the tutorial1_data.mat file
load('tutorial1_data.mat','targf','luref');

%% Define some variables of the experiment design and model fitting routine
[nConds, nBins] = size(targf); % Number of conditions and rating bins
fitStat = '-LL'; % The two options are '-LL' and 'SSE'

%% Generate the starting parameter values (x0), the lower bound of the estimates (LB), and the upper bounds (UB)
model = 'uvsd'; % Define the model to fit to the data
uvsdParNames = {'Dprime' 'Vo'}; % This defines the two parameters of the UVSD model (not criterion). 
[x0,LB,UB] = gen_pars(model,nBins,nConds,uvsdParNames); % Creates the x0, LB, and UB matrices

%% Use roc_solver to fit the UVSD model to the data, and store output in rocData
rocData = roc_solver(targf,luref,model,fitStat,x0,LB,UB);

%% Use roc_solver to fit the UVSD model and estimate the SE of the parameter estimates
bootIter = 100;
rocData = roc_solver(targf,luref,model,fitStat,x0,LB,UB,'bootIter',bootIter);

%% Add some additional options to the roc_solver to show its flexibility, and run roc_solver again
subID = 'tutorial1_subject'; % This is the subject ID
groupID = 'group1'; % This can be used for a between-group ID
condLabels = {'item recognition'}; % Define the condition labels
modelID = 'first uvsd model'; % This is a user defined ID for the current model
outpath = fileparts(which('tutorial1_data.mat')); % Define path to write summary figure

% Add options to the roc_solver
rocData = roc_solver(targf,luref,model,fitStat,x0,LB,UB, ...
    'subID',subID, ...
    'groupID',groupID, ...
    'condLabels',condLabels, ...
    'modelID',modelID, ...
    'saveFig',outpath);

%% Run a different variant of the EVSD model (make Vo = 1), and store with the UVSD model above
evsdParNames = {'Dprime'};

% First, generate the x0, LB, and UB vectors again, using the evsdParNames
[x0,LB,UB] = gen_pars(model,nBins,nConds,evsdParNames);

% Update modelID
modelID = 'first evsd model';

% Run the roc_solver again with the same options as above, and add the
% 'append' option.
rocData = roc_solver(targf,luref,model,fitStat,x0,LB,UB, ...
    'subID',subID, ...
    'groupID',groupID, ...
    'condLabels',condLabels, ...
    'modelID',modelID, ...
    'saveFig',outpath, ...
    'append',rocData);

% You will now notice that the model fit is not as good as the initial
% model (because the UVSD model generated the data), and that the Vo
% parameter is now equal to 1 (because the elements of LB and UB that
% correspond to the Vo parameter, or the second column of x0, both equal
% 1). Also, if you type rocData in the command window, you will now notice
% that the uvsd_model field is a 1x2 structure instead of a 1x1 structure.

%% Fit a different model, the DPSD model, to the data and store in rocData
% First, define some information relevant to fitting the dpsd model to the
% data. 
model = 'dpsd';
dpsdParNames = {'Ro' 'F'};
modelID = 'first dpsd model';

% Second, generate the x0, LB, and UB vectors for the dpsd model
[x0,LB,UB] = gen_pars(model,nBins,nConds,dpsdParNames);

% Run the roc_solver again with the same options as above.
rocData = roc_solver(targf,luref,model,fitStat,x0,LB,UB, ...
    'subID',subID, ...
    'groupID',groupID, ...
    'condLabels',condLabels, ...
    'modelID',modelID, ...
    'saveFig',outpath, ...
    'append',rocData);
